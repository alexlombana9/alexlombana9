# Alex Lombana

I'm a software developer passionate about building clean, maintainable applications with modern web technologies. My experience spans full-stack development with JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Node.js, as well as Python for backend and data visualization projects. I focus on creating robust systems with proper authentication, solid Git workflows, and automated CI/CD pipelines. I've worked on projects ranging from CRM platforms to interactive 3D visualizations, always prioritizing code quality, user experience, and maintainable architecture. I'm particularly interested in developer tooling, data-driven applications, and continuous improvement through automation.
